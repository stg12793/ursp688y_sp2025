    "# Assessing streetscape quality related to pedestrian crashes using self-supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Question\n",
    "The study aims to develop a self-supervised learning model to assess streetscape quality related to pedestrian crashes in Baltimore City. The project wants to assess the streetscape quality at a large scale based on street view images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Methods\n",
    "The methods include four key steps: street view images collection, labeling, self-supervised learning training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 1. Download street view images from Google Maps Platform using Street View Static API, captured in four different directions (90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 2. Label images manually based on strict rubric, and employ ChatGPT to generate pseudo-labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 3. Employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) like the ResNet-50 to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 4. Evaluate the model’s performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Data\n",
    "The data includes 1200 Baltimore City’s street view images, which are download from Google Maps Platform using API. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split as the train, validation, and test dataset. The train and validation dataset may total 1,100 Baltimore street view images (generated by ChatGPT, persudo-labeled images), with a ratio of 9:1 for training and validation. The test data contains 100 street view images (manually annotated), which have ground truth."
